a maze generator using a recursive backtracking algorithm.  
I know it may not be the cleanest code ðŸ˜… I just did it for fun.

## Run

for this to run you need to run it using these jvm arguments

`--module-path=lib/javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib/ --add-modules=javafx.controls -Xss4m`

if you're using VSCode then you don't need to worry about it, it's already been set in \\.vscode\launch.json
